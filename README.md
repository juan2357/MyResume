Welcome to MyResume repo

The website is deployed on Heroku. It uses Sinatra and Ruby to be able to be deployed on Heroku.

In the public folder you'll find and index.html file, a js, CSS, and img folder. 

The HTML file contains links to js files and a script link to google maps API. 

The helper.js file contains the variables used by the resumebuilder.js to append all the the objects to the HTML file. 

Enjoy.
